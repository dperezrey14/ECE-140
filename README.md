ANS1: No, <!DOCTYPE html> is not an HTML tag, it is essentially a decleration to the browser about what type of document that this file is. 
ANS2: By changing the title to my Name, The name of the website on the tab in the browser changes to my name "Dieg Perez"
ANS3: There isn't any structural difference between one header tag and anoter (i.e. h6 and h5). While the different headers by convention correspond to a hierarchy of headings, as long as the CSS file does not attribute a specific trait to a header tag, they can be used interchangably  
ANS4: When I refresed the page, the changes where undone. This is because I edited the file through the browser which does not actually edit the original HTML file. Therefore, all the changes made through the browser are not saved and when the page is refreshed, the original HTML file is displayed. 
ANS4.2: Since I edited the actual HTML file this time, the changes where permanent.
