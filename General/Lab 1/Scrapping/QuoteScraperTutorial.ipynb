We need to know the URL structure, the tags/ids/classes used for the information of relevance, etc.\n","\n","Let's have a look at the quotes webpage. If you look at the page's source, you will see that every quote tag URL is of the form <b>http://quotes.toscrape.com/tag/[tag_name]/page/[1or2]/ </b> and by observation we see that each page contains a maximum of 10 quotes. Using this information, we can get the HTML content of the page by using the method: `requests.get()`. You will learn about web requests in the coming week.\n","\n","For now, note that the `request.get()` method gets a response object returned by the server based on the given URL.
